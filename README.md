[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) offers a series of programming puzzles as an advent calendar, with a new puzzle being revealed every day leading up to Christmas.

In this repository, I present my solutions to these puzzles using Rust.

## Build and Run

Use `cargo` to build and run the solution for a specific day.

```
cargo run --bin day01
```
